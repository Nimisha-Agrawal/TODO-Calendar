Hi,

We have to create a TODO calendar. Attached are the UIs for Desktop and Mobile versions.

By default, the calendar should show the current month and there should be front and back buttons to navigate to next/previous months.

In mobile view the calendar should be hidden by default and clicking on the "Show Calendar" should open up the calendar.

You can use the browser’s local storage to store tasks created by the user on any date.

The functionalities to be incorporated are:

On clicking the “Add Task” button, a popup should open where I can give my task and select the date.

On clicking on any date, a popup should open where I can give my task and the date should be pre populated there.

The task list should display tasks in a sorted manner, sorted in ascending order of dates, only for the month for which the calendar is displayed.

For any day only 1 task can be added.

After a task is added for a date, that date tile should be highlighted.

There should be a validation on the date, such that I can’t add tasks for past dates.

If I click on any date for which a task is added, the task should be pre populated and if I make any changes it should be updated in the task list as well.

There should be an option to remove any added task.
